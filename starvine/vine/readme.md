Vines
======

Vines are nested tree structures.  The nodes are univariate marginal distributions
(starvine.uvar.uvd.Uvd)
and the edges are bivariate copula (starvine.bvcopula.pc_base.PairCopula).

To construct a vine sequentially starting from the top tree:

1. For each tree level in the vine:
    1. Determine the tree structure.  In the case of a regular vine, this is the
           maximum spanning tree with edge weights equal to kendall's tau.
    2. Fit copula (maximum likelihood) at all edges in the current tree
    3. Compute the conditional distribution at each edge in the current tree.
    4. Use conditional distribution as nodes in the next tree.
    5. Next


C-Vine
=======

In each tree level in a C-Vine (Canonical Vine), a central node is selected to which all
other nodes are attached via copula. (starvine.vine.C_vine.Cvine)

This dependence structure is favorable if a single primary variable drives changes in all
other variables in the system to some degree.  This primary variable could then be
selected as the "anchor" node.

D-Vine
======

In a D-Vine, every node is connected with exactly two other nodes via copula.

This dependence structure is well suited when no single primary variable of interest
can be identified.  It is also suitable for temporally ordered data.


Regular Vines
=============

Regular vines (R-vine) are the superset of all possible vine-copula structures.  C- and D-vines
are examples of valid regular vines.
